# Maea Matugas (Portfolio)

This is the portfolio that I will be using for my projects.

## Things That I Learned:

1. When creating a button it is better to add padding and add a color after.

2. Align the elements first then add: margin, padding and styles after.

3. It is better to use max-width rather than the normal width.
